# How to use

## Run

### Backup

Backup everything and save to a `.tar.gz` file with the current date and time. This will result in the file `/opt/rundeck-backup-2017-06-09--12-41-42.tar.gz` being created, where the timestamp is the time when the script started running.

    ./keeper.py backup --dest /opt

Backup only database and storage, to the file `/opt/rundeck-backup-partial-2017-06-09--12-46-09.tar.gz` being created. `-partial-` indicates that only some directories were backed up.

    ./keeper.py --dirs=/var/lib/rundeck/data,/var/lib/rundeck/var/storage backup --dest /opt/

### Restore

Restore all directories into their absolute paths on the host machine. If any file already exists, the restore **should** refuse to do anything and exit with an error and show the offending file.

    ./keeper.py restore --file /opt/rundeck-backup-2017-55-09--08-06-19.tar.gz

Restore only the directory `/var/lib/rundeck/data`.

    ./keeper.py --dirs=/var/lib/rundeck/data restore --file /opt/rundeck-backup-2017-55-09--08-06-19.tar.gz

* The [official docs](http://rundeck.org/2.6.11/administration/backup-and-recovery.html) describe two options: either manually copy all data, using a combination of tools, or export an archive file from the web. The latter can take several hours, and does not include all files you may need.
* [ersiko/rundeck-backup](https://github.com/ersiko/rundeck-backup) last commit 31 Mar 2013. There's a [blog post](https://blog.tomas.cat/en/2013/03/27/tool-manage-rundeck-backups/) describing how to use it.
